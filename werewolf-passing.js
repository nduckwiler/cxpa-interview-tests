/*
Instruction:
We all know that turning into a werewolf is not an instant thing. It happens in stages. So let's expand our program from before to accommodate that fact.

If the moon is `'mostly full'`, log `'Arms and legs are getting hairier'`.
If the moon is `'mostly new'`, log `'Back on two feet'`.
If someone enters in an invalid moon phase, log `'Invalid moon phase'`.
*/

// Passing code. This code satisfies the tests but does not satisfy the instruction.

if (moonPhase === 'full') {

} else if (moonPhase === 'mostly full') {

} else if (moonPhase === 'mostly new') {

} else {
  return 'Invalid';

}
